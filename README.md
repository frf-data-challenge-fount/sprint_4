# Sprint 3

In this courselet, you will learn about relevant metrics derived from TLS. You will also start working on an approach to predict tree metrics using ML. Two introductory notebooks are provided: `tls-metrics.ipynb` and `TL_w_ALS.ipynb`. Additionally, a base notebook, `sprint3_team-name.ipynb`, outlines two specific tasks for your team to complete.

Before running the notebooks, ensure that all dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file are installed.

**NOTE**: This courselet is an adaptation of the original Sprint 3 content delivered as part of the [Fire-Ready Forests Data Challenge](https://nationaldataplatform.org/educationhub/datachallenge/learner/1b1cbc30-8477-4cb9-b8a9-c0769999c7d1), which was hosted by the [National Data Platform](https://nationaldataplatform.org/) from February 19 to April 18, 2025.
