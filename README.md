# Sprint 4

In this course, you will predict relevant tree metrics from a tree list derived from TLS. A single notebook has been provided with instructions on which tasks to complete.

There is no `requirements.txt` file for this courselet because each learner is free to choose any open library to complete the tasks.

**NOTE**: This courselet is an adaptation of the original Sprint 4 content delivered as part of the [Fire-Ready Forests Data Challenge](https://nationaldataplatform.org/educationhub/datachallenge/learner/1b1cbc30-8477-4cb9-b8a9-c0769999c7d1), which was hosted by the [National Data Platform](https://nationaldataplatform.org/) from February 19 to April 18, 2025.
